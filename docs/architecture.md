# Architecture

This document describes the model: the pointer readout, the three question types, the
training objective and the design decisions behind them. It ends with the repository
layout. Paths are relative to the repository root unless they are links. A module path
such as `data/teacher.py` or `infer.py` is relative to `src/strands_decider/`; the scripts under
`data/generators/` and `data/checks/` are relative to the repository root.

```

Take a pretrained decoder LLM, **discard its language-modelling head**, and score each
option by comparing the question's answer position against that option's own hidden
state. One forward pass, no generation, no decoding loop.

A request renders to a single prompt:

```
<state>
Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.
</state>
<question type="choice">
Select exactly one option.
Which team should handle this?
<options>
1. billing — payments, invoices, payouts
2. technical — bugs, outages, API errors
3. sales — pricing and upgrades
</options>
</question>
<answer>
```

The torso runs once. The readout then takes the hidden state at `<answer>` as a query
and the hidden state at the **last token of each option's line** as keys — that token
has just read its whole option under causal attention — and scores one against the
others:

```python
logit_k = <q(h_answer), k(h_option_k)> / sqrt(dim)
```

Softmax over those `K` logits is the answer. That is the entire inference path.

**An option's score depends on what it says, not where it sits.** There is no
per-option parameter anywhere in the model, so nothing can learn that "the first
option is usually the right one", and nothing caps how many options a question may
carry. The same weights answer a two-option yes/no and a thirty-option routing
question, with label sets never seen in training, because the prompt alone establishes
what each option means.

Three consequences worth stating plainly:

- **Runtime-defined labels.** Options are read from the request, not baked into the
  weights. No retraining to add a category.
- **No option ceiling.** The schema's 255 is the only limit.
- **Order sensitivity is small but not zero.** Reversing the option list moves the
  distribution by ~0.016, because options still attend to earlier options under causal
  attention. Eliminating it entirely needs per-option attention isolation, which is not
  implemented here.

The readout is ~1M parameters (`dim=256`); rank-16 LoRA adapters on the torso's
projections are the only other thing trained. The v14 checkpoint is ~88 MB — adapter,
readout and tokenizer — and the base weights are fetched from HuggingFace at load.

**The torso.** v13 to v19 run Qwen3.5-2B-Base (1.9B parameters), a hybrid: 18 of its 24
layers are Gated DeltaNet — linear attention carrying a recurrent state — and 6 are full
attention. LoRA covers the projections of both kinds (`lora_targets`). v7 and earlier
ran Qwen3-1.7B-Base, all full attention. The architecture is the same either way; what
the hybrid changes is serving ([Asking many questions is nearly free](inference.md#asking-many-questions-is-nearly-free)) and the
training environment ([Setup](../training/README.md#setup)).

### One mechanism, three primitives

All three question types are the same masked softmax read back differently:

| Primitive  | Options      | Returns                                        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Noul**   | 2 (false/true) | `P(true)`                                    |
| **Choice** | N options    | argmax + per-option probabilities + confidence |
| **Score**  | L levels (2–10, ordered) | expected value `Σ i·pᵢ` + distribution + confidence |

**Confidence is derived, not predicted.** For `choice` it is the normalised
max-probability:

```
confidence = (N · p_max − 1) / (N − 1)
```

Uniform → 0, one-hot → 1, and crucially *independent of N*, so one routing threshold
means the same thing for a 3-option and a 10-option question. Noul has no confidence
field because with two outcomes the probability already is the uncertainty.

#### The routing convention

These documents use the example bands of the public Jev API documentation
([Confidence](https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence)). At 0.9 or above, act without a
check. From 0.5 to 0.9, confirm first. Below 0.5, send the answer to a person. That
documentation says that the right thresholds depend on the consequences of each
action. Measure them on your own traffic before you rely on them
([Summary](../evaluation/results.md#summary) gives the measured bands).

**`score` uses a different measure**, because max-probability reads *spread* as
*doubt* — and on an ordered scale, mass on adjacent levels is precision, not
confusion. A distribution split between levels 2 and 3 is confidently saying "about
2.5". So score confidence is normalised standard deviation:

```
sigma = sqrt( sum_i p_i * (i - mean)^2 )        confidence = 1 - sigma / sigma_max
```

This also fixes an ordering bug: max-probability ranks a bimodal distribution (mass
at both ends) *above* a uniform one, when bimodal is the worst case for an ordinal —
the returned expected value falls exactly where the model thinks the answer is not.

The floor is corrected for ordinal smoothing. Training deliberately puts `eps` of each
target on neighbouring levels, so a perfectly fitted model still shows sigma ~
sqrt(eps). Without that correction a 3-level score capped at 0.68 confidence, making
the ">= 0.9 act automatically" band of the [routing convention](#the-routing-convention)
unreachable by construction.

### Training

The loss has three parts:

- **Cross-entropy on the gold label**, with 10% of a `score` target's mass moved to
  adjacent levels: being one level off is a smaller error than being four off.
- **KL to the frozen torso's own readout** (weight 0.3): the same torso with its adapter
  disabled, reading the option-number tokens it would emit after `<answer>`. It keeps the
  model near what pretraining already knew, for one extra forward pass and no extra
  weights.
- **KL to a frozen teacher** (weight 1.0), on the multi-step rows only: Qwen3.5-4B, read
  without any training ([What the torso knows untrained](../research/history.md#what-the-torso-knows-untrained)), its option distributions
  computed once and stored (`data/teacher.py`). It is used only where it is measurably
  better than the student: distilled on short classification, where it is not, it moved
  nothing ([v12](../research/history.md#v12-distilling-a-frozen-qwen35-4b)).

v14's corpus is 100,449 rows from 21 public classification tasks — topic, intent,
sentiment, entailment, ordinal ratings, yes/no, rule chaining — plus 12,909 multi-step
rows from ContractNLI, MuSiQue and BoardgameQA ([Data sources and licences](../data/README.md#data-sources-and-licences)).
The v19 reference recipe adds 3,815 generated document questions and 6,166
answer-adequacy rows.

One detail matters more than any of the loss terms:

> **Option order is re-shuffled on every example, every epoch, and the label is
> remapped to follow.**

Without that, the heads quietly memorise "slot 0 tends to be the positive class" and
genericity is lost. With it, the only strategy that survives gradient descent is
actually reading the option text. Score questions are the exception — their slots are
ordinal, so they are only ever *reversed* (rubric and label together), never permuted.

## Design decisions worth knowing

**Causal attention, read at the right tokens.** The note sketching this architecture likened
it to BERT, and a bidirectional encoder would pool better in principle. But converting
a causal LLM to bidirectional attention requires substantial retraining to recover what
you break. Keeping attention causal uses the pretrained weights exactly as they were
trained, which matters when the adaptation budget is one 3090. Under causal attention
the `<answer>` position has read the whole prompt and each option's last token has read
that option, so they are sound positions to read.

**Head in fp32.** The torso runs bf16; the head is tiny and a low-precision classifier
is a needless source of calibration error.

**Ordinal smoothing for scores.** Being one level off is a much smaller error than
being four off, and plain cross-entropy cannot express that. Score targets put 10% of
their mass on adjacent levels.

**Teacher targets only where the teacher is better.** Distillation transfers the
teacher's behaviour on the prompts it is given. On short classification the frozen 4B
was no better than the student, and distilling there moved nothing on JevBench (v12);
on multi-step documents it was far better, and there it helped (v14). Measure the
teacher against the student on the prompts first.

**Remove the shortcuts the data allows.** The model learns whatever cheaply predicts the
label: one fixed question per task taught it to ignore questions (v11), and ContractNLI's
per-claim priors would have taught it to skip the contract. Balance them away, keep
minimal pairs together (MuSiQue's answerable and unanswerable versions), and when the
student beats its teacher on a converted dataset, test for artefacts of the conversion
before believing it (v14).

**Drop, never truncate.** A prompt cut through its option list would score an option from
a neighbour's representation. Training and evaluation drop rows over the window; at
serving time the question's tokens are reserved first and the state is cut from the
front (`_fit` in `infer.py`).

**Hybrid torsos share the prefix too.** A Gated DeltaNet layer carries convolution and
recurrent states instead of keys and values. The cache fork (`_expand_cache` in
`infer.py`) repeats those along with the keys and values, into new layer objects, dicts
and tensors — the layer updates its states and flags in place, so a fork sharing them
would corrupt the prefix — following decider-2b's `shared_prefix.py`. A layer holding
any other tensor raises `UnforkableCache`, and the engine falls back to exact batched
encoding rather than guess whether it has a batch dimension.
